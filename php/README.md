#PHP Programming

Visual Studio Code is a great editor for PHP development. You get features like syntax highlighting and bracket matching, IntelliSense (code completion), and snippets out of the box and you can add more functionality through community created VS Code [extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery).

##PHP Extensions

There are many PHP language extensions available on the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode) and more are being created. You can search for PHP extensions from within VS Code by running the Extensions: Install Extension command (Ctrl+Shift+P and type ext install) then filter the extensions drop down list by typing php.

For example, install "PHP Extension Pack" by Felix Becker from the VS Code Marketplace. 
It has a five-star rating! 

After 'Install', click 'Reload' for the changes to take effect.
